# PoShProfiles


**This repository will eventually contain my personal well developed PowerShell Profiles for a few different deployment environments...**

The following profiles will be here...

* **profile.ps1**      -      This is the allhosts profile I use on my personal desktop or noteboook systems.
* **HTL-Subprofile.ps1**      -      This is a secondary profile that I execute on my homelab systems.
                          -      It adds objects and functions that automate administration of my homelab domain.  
* **HTL-profile.ps1**      -      This is the default profile that runs on all systems that use Powershell in the Homeone Domain
                              It is very similar to my personal desktop allhost profile listed at the top.
